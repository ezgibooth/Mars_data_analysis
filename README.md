# Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

part_1_mars_news.ipynb script is used to scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles:

    Automated browsing is used to visit the Mars news siteLinks to an external site.

    Page is inspected to identify which elements to scrape.

    Beautiful Soup object is used to extract text elements from the website.

    Titles and preview text of the news articles are scraped. 
    
    The scraping results is stored in Python data structures as follows:

        Each title-and-preview pair is stored in a Python dictionary with two keys: title and preview. An example is the following:

        {'title': "NASA's MAVEN Observes Martian Light Show Caused by Major Solar Storm", 
        'preview': "For the first time in its eight years orbiting Mars, NASAâ€™s MAVEN mission witnessed two different types of ultraviolet aurorae simultaneously, the result of solar storms that began on Aug. 27."}

        All the dictionaries are stored in a Python list.

    The scraped data is exported to a CSV file, mars_json.csv    


# Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

part_2_mars_weather.ipynb is used to analyze the Mars weather data.

    Use automated browsing to visit the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html.

    A Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table

    The scraped data is assembled into a Pandas Data Frame with the following column headings:

        - id: the identification number of a single transmission from the Curiosity rover
        - terrestrial_date: the date on Earth
        - sol: the number of elapsed sols (Martian days) since Curiosity landed on Mars
        - ls: the solar longitude
        - month: the Martian month
        - min_temp: the minimum temperature, in Celsius, of a single Martian day (sol)
        - pressure: The atmospheric pressure at Curiosity's location


    The dataset is analyzed by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:

        - How many months exist on Mars?
        - How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
        - What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
            --Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
            --Plot the results as a bar chart.
       -  Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
            --Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
            --Plot the results as a bar chart.
        - About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
            --Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
            --Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.

    The final DataFrame is exported into a CSV file, mars_data.csv
